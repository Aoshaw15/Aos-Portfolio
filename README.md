## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br>
<br>
I started out with a template to help with screen optimization. Once that was situated, I went to work on my HTML making sure I covered the basics of what I wanted my portfolio to include such as, a project and contact area. I took to css to enchance the visual integrity of the site. Finally, Javascript was used to add onclick and hover events to change the style of the css.
## Optimizations
Since this is one of my first projects, there is a lot that can be worked on. The overall layout is well done but I would have liked to implement more javascript and back end capabilities to round out the website. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about patience with this project. Starting off with a template, learning what the previous engineer put and how each section worked was a task that I thoroughly enjoyed but at times despised. Also, knowing my skills are not to the highest of caliber at the moment due to this being my one of my first websites I've made, I had to respect my boundaries in what I understood and did not.
